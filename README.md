# FileWordFinder

Well, this is my first "normal" attempt in creating git project. Yay!

## What is here?

Here is my project, which was recommended to me by a friend and i think it`s going to be very useful.

It can help you find words in .txt and objects in .xml. All you need to do is select a directory. Also, I want to add a feature that will find something in .html files, but I can't decide what it will be.

Moreover, it can simply display the files and their number.
